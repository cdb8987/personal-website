I am addicted to learning new things....piano, chess, brazilian jiu jitsu....and now software development. Fortunately, with the latter, the learning literally never stops.  The rabbit hole just keeps going. I was hooked when I finished building a command line chess game in Python.  I was blown away that something that I loved in the physical world could be created....one small step at at time....simply by thinking and pressing buttons.
